:mod:`lab03_complex_types` -- Complex Data Types 
===================================================

Create and print an initialized variable for each of the complex types:
   tuple, list, dict, set
   (each should have 3 objects)   

How are tuples commonly used?

What does changing an object "in-place" mean?

Use the append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), count(), sort(), reverse(), and index() 
functions on your list. Print each result.

Use the iteritems(), iterkeys(), itervalues() on your dictionary. Print the
   results.

Use the "in" operator to find a key in your dictionary.

Make a copy of your dictionary with copy(). Print the copy.
